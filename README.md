# Notes_of_Graphics

<!--[Webpage]()-->

This repo hosts my notes and some homeworks in **computer graphics**. These courses are basically from *GAMES (Graphics and Mixed Environment Seminar)* and *Taichi Graphics Course*. The major topics are **rendering** and **physics-based animations**.



Following notebooks are updating.

- UPDATING



---

This repo will be maintained in **English**.

The assignments will be updated **after the ddl**.

Since GitHub doesn't support LaTeX formula in Markdown files, the notes will be converted into html files with a Typora Markdown source file as well. Some specific features are only supported in Typora.
