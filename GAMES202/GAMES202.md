# Lecture 1 Introduction and Overview

## Topics

**Real-Time High Quality Rendering**

- **Real-Time**
  - Speed: more than <u>30 fps</u> (VR/AR: 90 fps)
  - Interactivity: each frame generated <u>on the fly</u>
- **High Quality**
  - Realism: advanced approaches to make rendering more realistic
  - Dependability: all-time <u>correctness (exact or approx)</u>; no tolerance to (uncontrollable) failures
- **Rendering**

**Main Topics**

Highest Level: 4 parts on real-time rendering

<u>Shadows</u> (and env) / <u>Global Illum.</u> (Scene/image space, precomputed) / <u>Physically-based Shading</u> / <u>Real-time Ray Tracing</u>
