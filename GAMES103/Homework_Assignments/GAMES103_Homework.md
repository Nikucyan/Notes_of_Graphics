## Lab 1: Angry Bunny

**Rigid Body Collision**

Given: Unity package `bunny.unitypackage` and prepared imcompleted scripts.

### Tasks

#### 1. Basic Tasks: (Impulse method)

1. Position Update in `Update` function: 

   Update both the **position** & the **orientation** by **Leapfrog integration**.

   Disable the motion and position update if `launch = false`.

2. Velocity Update:

   Calculate the **gravity** force to update the velocity.

   Produce **damping effects** by multiply the velocity by decay factors.

   No need to calculate torque or angular velocity.

3. Collision Detection in `Collision_Impulse` function:

   Calculate the position and velocity of **every mesh vertex** and determine if in collision.

   If collide, compute the **average** of all colliding vertices.
   
3. Collision Response:

   Apply the impulse-based method to calculate the **impulse** `j` for the average colliding position.

   Update the **linear and angular velocities** accordingly.
   
3. Collision with the Wall:

   Collide with the side wall as well.

#### 2. Bonus Tasks: (Shape matching)

Complete the other script with shape matching method.

## Lab 2: Cloth Simulation

**Soft-matter Simulation**

Given: `cloth.unitypackage `(a retangular cloth piece and a sphere). The cloth piece was defaultly set with 21 x 21 =  441 vertices

Requirement: drag the sphere and have the cloth interactive simulation with the sphere

### Tasks [WIP]

#### 1. Implicit Cloth Solver

1. Initial Setup: For every vertex, apply damping to velocity `v *= damping` and `X[i]~ = X[i] + dt * V[i]`

#### 2. Position-Based Dynamics (PBD)
